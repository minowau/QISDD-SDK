📝 SUMMARY FOR BEGINNERS:
Your QISDD system is actively protecting your data using quantum-inspired technology!
3 quantum states were created, which means your data is now
split into multiple encrypted pieces that automatically defend against unauthorized access.
The system successfully blocked 1 hacking attempts while allowing
1 legitimate users to access their data safely.

Think of quantum states like having 3 different security guards watching over
your data - if someone tries to break in without permission, the guards automatically
change the locks and sound the alarm! 🚨
